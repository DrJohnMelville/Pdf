	/// <summary> This is a generic abstract class to store data from a block of an
	/// image. This class does not have the notion of components. Therefore, it
	/// should be used for data from a single component. Subclasses should
	/// implement the different types of storage (<tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>,
	/// etc.).
	/// 
	/// The data is always stored in one array, of the type matching the data
	/// type (i.e. for 'int' it's an 'int[]'). The data should be stored in the
	/// array in standard scan-line order. That is the samples go from the top-left
	/// corner of the code-block to the lower-right corner by line and then
	/// column.
	/// 
	/// The member variable 'offset' gives the index in the array of the first
	/// data element (i.e. the top-left coefficient (ulx,uly)). The member variable
	/// 'scanw' gives the width of the scan that is used to store the data, that
	/// can be different from the width of the block. Element '(x,y)' of the
	/// code-block (i.e. '(ulx,uly)' is the top-left coefficient), will appear at
	/// position 'offset+(y-uly)*scanw+(x-ulx)' in the array of data.
	/// 
	/// A block of data can have the <i>progressive</i> attribute set. Data is
	/// progressive when it is obtained by successive refinement and the values in
	/// this block are approximations of the "final" values. When the final values
	/// are returned the progressive attribute must be turned off.
	/// 
	/// The classes <tt>DataBlkInt</tt> and <tt>DataBlkFloat</tt> provide
	/// implementations for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>float</tt> types respectively.</summary>
	/// <seealso cref="DataBlkInt" />
