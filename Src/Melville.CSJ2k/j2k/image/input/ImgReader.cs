	/// <summary> This is the generic interface to be implemented by all image file (or other
	/// resource) readers for different image file formats.
	/// 
	/// An ImgReader behaves as an ImgData object. Whenever image data is
	/// requested through the getInternCompData() or getCompData() methods, the
	/// image data will be read (if it is not buffered) and returned. Implementing
	/// classes should not buffer large amounts of data, so as to reduce memory
	/// usage.
	/// 
	/// This class sets the image origin to (0,0). All default implementations
	/// of the methods assume this.
	/// 
	/// This class provides default implementations of many methods. These
	/// default implementations assume that there is no tiling (i.e., the only tile
	/// is the entire image), that the image origin is (0,0) in the canvas system
	/// and that there is no component subsampling (all components are the same
	/// size), but they can be overloaded by the implementating class if need
	/// be.</summary>
