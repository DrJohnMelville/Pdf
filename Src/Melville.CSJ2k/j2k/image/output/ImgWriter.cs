	/// resource) writers for different formats.
	/// 
	/// Each object inheriting from this class should have a source ImgData
	/// object associated with it. The image data to write to the file is obtained
	/// from the associated ImgData object. In general this object would be
	/// specified at construction time.
	/// 
	/// Depending on the actual type of file that is written a call to any
	/// write() or writeAll() method will write data from one component, several
	/// components or all components. For example, a PGM writer will write data
	/// from only one component (defined in the constructor) while a PPM writer
	/// will write 3 components (normally R,G,B).
