	/// <summary> This abstract class defines methods to transfer wavelet data in a
	/// code-block by code-block basis. In each call to 'getNextCodeBlock()' or
	/// 'getNextInternCodeBlock()' a new code-block is returned. The code-blocks
	/// are returned in no specific order.
	/// 
	/// This class is the source of data for the quantizer. See the 'Quantizer'
	/// class.
	/// 
	/// Note that no more of one object may request data, otherwise one object
	/// would get some of the data and another one another part, in no defined
	/// manner.
