	/// <summary> This is a generic abstract class to store a code-block of wavelet data,
	/// quantized or not. This class does not have the notion of
	/// components. Therefore, it should be used for data from a single
	/// component. Subclasses should implement the different types of storage
	/// (<tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, etc.).
	/// 
	/// The data is always stored in one array, of the type matching the data
	/// type (i.e. for 'int' it's an 'int[]'). The data should be stored in the
	/// array in standard scan-line order. That is the samples go from the top-left
	/// corner of the code-block to the lower-right corner by line and then
	/// column.
	/// 
	/// The member variable 'offset' gives the index in the array of the first
	/// data element (i.e. the top-left coefficient). The member variable 'scanw'
	/// gives the width of the scan that is used to store the data, that can be
	/// different from the width of the block. Element '(x,y)' of the code-block
	/// (i.e. '(0,0)' is the top-left coefficient), will appear at position
	/// 'offset+y*scanw+x' in the array of data.
	/// 
	/// The classes <tt>CBlkWTDataInt</tt> and <tt>CBlkWTDataFloat</tt> provide
	/// implementations for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>float</tt> types respectively.
	/// 
	/// The types of data are the same as those defined by the 'DataBlk'
	/// class.
