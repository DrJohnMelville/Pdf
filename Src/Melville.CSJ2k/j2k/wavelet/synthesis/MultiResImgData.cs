	/// <summary> This interface defines methods to access image attributes (width, height,
	/// number of components, etc.) of multiresolution images, such as those
	/// resulting from an inverse wavelet transform. The image can be tiled or not
	/// (i.e. if the image is not tiled then there is only 1 tile). It should be
	/// implemented by all classes that provide multi-resolution image data, such
	/// as entropy decoders, dequantizers, etc. This interface, however, does not
	/// define methods to transfer image data (i.e. pixel data), that is defined by
	/// other interfaces, such as 'CBlkQuantDataSrcDec'.
	/// 
	/// This interface is very similar to the 'ImgData' one. It differs only by
	/// the fact that it handles multiple resolutions.
	/// 
	/// Resolution levels are counted from 0 to L. Resolution level 0 is the
	/// lower resolution, while L is the maximum resolution level, or full
	/// resolution, which is returned by 'getMaxResLvl()'. Note that there are L+1
	/// resolution levels available.
	/// 
	/// As in the 'ImgData' interface a multi-resolution image lies on top of a
	/// canvas. The canvas coordinates are mapped from the full resolution
	/// reference grid (i.e. resolution level 'L' reference grid) to a resolution
	/// level 'l' reference grid by '(x_l,y_l) =
	/// (ceil(x_l/2^(L-l)),ceil(y_l/2^(L-l)))', where '(x,y)' are the full
	/// resolution reference grid coordinates and '(x_l,y_l)' are the level 'l'
	/// reference grid coordinates.
	/// 
	/// For details on the canvas system and its implications consult the
	/// 'ImgData' interface.
	/// 
	/// Note that tile sizes may not be obtained by simply dividing the tile
	/// size in the reference grid by the subsampling factor.
