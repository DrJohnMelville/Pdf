	/// <summary> This abstract class defines the methods of all synthesis wavelet
	/// filters. Specialized abstract classes that work on particular data types
	/// (int, float) provide more specific method calls while retaining the
	/// generality of this one. See the SynWTFilterInt and SynWTFilterFloat
	/// classes. Implementations of snythesis filters should inherit from one of
	/// those classes.
	/// 
	/// The length of the output signal is always the sum of the length of the
	/// low-pass and high-pass input signals.
	/// 
	/// All synthesis wavelet filters should follow the following conventions:
	/// 
	/// <ul> 
	/// 
	/// <li>The first sample of the output corresponds to the low-pass one. As a
	/// consequence, if the output signal is of odd-length then the low-pass input
	/// signal is one sample longer than the high-pass input one. Therefore, if the
	/// length of output signal is N, the low-pass input signal is of length N/2 if
	/// N is even and N/2+1/2 if N is odd, while the high-pass input signal is of
	/// length N/2 if N is even and N/2-1/2 if N is odd.</li>
	/// 
	/// <li>The normalization of the analysis filters is 1 for the DC gain and 2
	/// for the Nyquist gain (Type I normalization), for both reversible and
	/// non-reversible filters. The normalization of the synthesis filters should
	/// ensure prefect reconstruction according to this normalization of the
	/// analysis wavelet filters.</li>
	/// 
	/// </ul>
	/// 
	/// The synthetize method may seem very complicated, but is designed to
	/// minimize the amount of data copying and redundant calculations when used
	/// for block-based or line-based wavelet transform implementations, while
	/// being applicable to full-frame transforms as well.
	///
