	/// subband decomposition for a wavelet transform, specifically for the
	/// syhthesis side.

	/// The element can be either a node or a leaf of the tree. If it is a node
	/// then ther are 4 descendants (LL, HL, LH and HH). If it is a leaf there are

	/// "parent", which is the subband from which the element was obtained by
	/// decomposition. The only exception is the root element which has no parent
	/// (i.e.it's null), for obvious reasons.
