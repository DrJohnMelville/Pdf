	/// <summary> This abstract class represents a subband in a bidirectional tree structure
	/// that describes the subband decomposition for a wavelet transform. This
	/// class is implemented by the SubbandAn and SubbandSyn classes, which are for
	/// the analysis and synthesis sides respectively.
	/// 
	/// The element can be either a node or a leaf of the tree. If it is a node,
	/// it has 4 descendants (LL, HL, LH and HH). If it is a leaf, it has no
	/// descendant.
	/// 
	/// The tree is bidirectional. Each element in the tree structure has a
	/// "parent", which is the subband from which the element was obtained by
	/// decomposition. The only exception is the root element which, for obvious
	/// reasons, has no parent (i.e. it is null).
