	/// <summary> This class implements a wrapper to turn an InputStream into a
	/// RandomAccessIO. To provide random access, the input data from the
	/// InputStream is cached in an in-memory buffer. The in-memory buffer size can
	/// be limited to a specified size. The data is read into the cache on a as
	/// needed basis, blocking only when necessary.
	/// 
	/// The cache grows automatically as necessary. However, if the data length
	/// is known prior to the creation of a ISRandomAccessIO object, it is best to
	/// specify that as the initial in-memory buffer size. That will minimize data
	/// copying and multiple allocation.
	/// 
	/// Multi-byte data is read in big-endian order. The in-memory buffer
	/// storage is released when 'close()' is called. This class can only be used
	/// for data input, not output. The wrapped InputStream is closed when all the
	/// input data is cached or when 'close()' is called.
	/// 
	/// If an out of memory condition is encountered when growing the in-memory
	/// buffer an IOException is thrown instead of an OutOfMemoryError. The
	/// exception message is "Out of memory to cache input data".
	/// 
	/// This class is intended for use as a "quick and dirty" way to give
	/// network connectivity to RandomAccessIO based classes. It is not intended as
	/// an efficient means of implementing network connectivity. Doing such
	/// requires reimplementing the RandomAccessIO based classes to directly use
	/// network connections.
	/// 
	/// This class does not use temporary files as buffers, because that would
	/// preclude the use in unsigned applets.
