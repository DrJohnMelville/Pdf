    /// threads. Also a default facility exists that is used for threads
    /// for which no particular facility has been registerd registered.

    /// separated.
    /// The default MsgLogger is a StreamMsgLogger that uses System.out as
    /// the 'out' stream and System.err as the 'err' stream, and a line width of
