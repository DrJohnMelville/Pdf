    /// display, etc., or a combination of those.
    /// Messages are short strings (a couple of lines) that indicate some state
    /// of the program, and that have a severity code associated with them (see
    /// below). Simple strings is text (can be long) that has no severity code
    /// associated with it. Typical use of simple strings is to display help
    /// texts.
    /// Each message has a severity code, which can be one of the following:
    /// LOG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. Each implementation should treat each severity
    /// code in a way which corresponds to the type of diplay used.
    /// Messages are printed via the 'printmsg()' method. Simple strings are
    /// printed via the 'print()', 'println()' and 'flush()' methods, each simple
    /// string is considered to be terminated once the 'flush()' method has been
    /// called. The 'printmsg()' method should never be called before a previous
