	/// <summary> This is the abstract class from which all dequantizers must inherit. This
	/// class has the concept of a current tile and all operations are performed on
	/// the current tile.
	/// 
	/// This class provides default implemenations for most of the methods
	/// (wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image and
	/// component dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the dequantizer. If
	/// that is not the case for a particular implementation then the methods
	/// should be overriden.
	/// 
	/// Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
	/// the input data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
	/// positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
	/// is stored in the next most significat bits. The most significant magnitude
	/// bit corresponds to the most significant bit-plane and so on.
	/// 
	/// The output data is either in floating-point, or in fixed-point two's
	/// complement. In case of floating-point data the the value returned by
	/// getFixedPoint() must be 0. If the case of fixed-point data the number of
	/// fractional bits must be defined at the constructor of the implementing
	/// class and all operations must be performed accordingly. Each component may
	/// have a different number of fractional bits.
