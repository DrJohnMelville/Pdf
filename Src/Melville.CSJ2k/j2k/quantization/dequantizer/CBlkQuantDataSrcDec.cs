	/// <summary> This interface defines a source of quantized wavelet coefficients and
	/// methods to transfer them in a code-block by code-block basis, fro the
	/// decoder side. In each call to 'getCodeBlock()' or 'getInternCodeBlock()' a
	/// new code-block is returned.
	/// 
	/// This class is the source of data for the dequantizer. See the
	/// 'Dequantizer' class.
	/// 
	/// Code-block data is returned in sign-magnitude representation, instead of
	/// the normal two's complement one. Only integral types are used. The sign
	/// magnitude representation is more adequate for entropy coding. In sign
	/// magnitude representation, the most significant bit is used for the sign (0
	/// if positive, 1 if negative) and the magnitude of the coefficient is stored
	/// in the next M most significant bits. The rest of the bits (least
	/// significant bits) can contain a fractional value of the quantized
	/// coefficient. The number 'M' of magnitude bits is communicated in the
	/// 'magbits' member variable of the 'CBlkWTData'.
