	/// <summary> This abstract class provides the general interface for quantizers. The
	/// input of a quantizer is the output of a wavelet transform. The output of
	/// the quantizer is the set of quantized wavelet coefficients represented in
	/// sign-magnitude notation (see below).
	/// 
	/// This class provides default implementation for most of the methods
	/// (wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image, component
	/// dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the quantizer. If it is not
	/// the case for a particular implementation, then the methods should be
	/// overriden.
	/// 
	/// Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
	/// the output data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
	/// positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
	/// is stored in the next M most significat bits. The rest of the bits (least
	/// significant bits) can contain a fractional value of the quantized
	/// coefficient. This fractional value is not to be coded by the entropy
	/// coder. However, it can be used to compute rate-distortion measures with
	/// greater precision.
	/// 
	/// The value of M is determined for each subband as the sum of the number
	/// of guard bits G and the nominal range of quantized wavelet coefficients in
	/// the corresponding subband (Rq), minus 1:
	/// 
	/// M = G + Rq -1
	/// 
	/// The value of G should be the same for all subbands. The value of Rq
	/// depends on the quantization step size, the nominal range of the component
	/// before the wavelet transform and the analysis gain of the subband (see
	/// Subband).
	/// 
	/// The blocks of data that are requested should not cross subband
	/// boundaries.
	/// 
	/// NOTE: At the moment only quantizers that implement the
	/// 'CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc' interface are supported.
