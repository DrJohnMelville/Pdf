	/// <summary> This interface defines a source of quantized wavelet coefficients and
	/// methods to transfer them in a code-block by code-block basis. In each call
	/// to 'getNextCodeBlock()' or 'getNextInternCodeBlock()' a new code-block is
	/// returned. The code-blocks are returned in no specific order.
	/// 
	/// This class is the source of data for the entropy coder. See the
	/// 'EntropyCoder' class.
	/// 
	/// Code-block data is returned in sign-magnitude representation, instead of
	/// the normal two's complement one. Only integral types are used. The sign
	/// magnitude representation is more adequate for entropy coding. In sign
	/// magnitude representation, the most significant bit is used for the sign (0
	/// if positive, 1 if negative) and the magnitude of the coefficient is stored
	/// in the next M most significant bits. The rest of the bits (least
	/// significant bits) can contain a fractional value of the quantized
	/// coefficient. The number 'M' of magnitude bits is communicated in the
	/// 'magbits' member variable of the 'CBlkWTData'.
	/// 
	/// Note that no more of one object may request data, otherwise one object
	/// would get some of the data and another one another part, in no defined
	/// manner.
