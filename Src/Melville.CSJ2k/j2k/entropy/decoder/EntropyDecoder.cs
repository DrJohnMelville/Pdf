	/// through the 'MultiResImgDataAdapter' abstract class.

	/// Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
	/// the output data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
	/// positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
	/// is stored in the next most significat bits. The most significant magnitude
	/// bit corresponds to the most significant bit-plane and so on.</p
