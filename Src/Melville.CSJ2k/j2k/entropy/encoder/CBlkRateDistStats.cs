	/// <summary> This class stores coded (compressed) code-blocks with their associated
	/// rate-distortion statistics. This object should always contain all the
	/// compressed data of the code-block. It is applicable to the encoder engine
	/// only. Some data of the coded-block is stored in the super class, see
	/// CodedCBlk.
	/// 
	/// The rate-distortion statistics (i.e. R-D slope) is stored for valid
	/// points only. The set of valid points is determined by the entropy coder
	/// engine itself. Normally they are selected so as to lye in a convex hull,
	/// which can be achived by using the 'selectConvexHull' method of this class,
	/// but some other strategies might be employed.
	/// 
	/// The rate (in bytes) for each truncation point (valid or not) is stored
	/// in the 'truncRates' array. The rate of a truncation point is the total
	/// number of bytes in 'data' (see super class) that have to be decoded to
	/// reach the truncation point.
	/// 
	/// The slope (reduction of distortion divided by the increase in rate) at
	/// each of the valid truncation points is stored in 'truncSlopes'.
	/// 
	/// The index of each valid truncation point is stored in 'truncIdxs'. The
	/// index should be interpreted in the following way: a valid truncation point
	/// at position 'n' has the index 'truncIdxs[n]', the rate
	/// 'truncRates[truncIdxs[n]]' and the slope 'truncSlopes[n]'. The arrays
	/// 'truncIdxs' and 'truncRates' have at least 'nVldTrunc' elements. The
	/// 'truncRates' array has at least 'nTotTrunc' elements.
	/// 
	/// In addition the 'isTermPass' array contains a flag for each truncation
	/// point (valid and non-valid ones) that tells if the pass is terminated or
	/// not. If this variable is null then it means that no pass is terminated,
	/// except the last one which always is.
	/// 
	/// The compressed data is stored in the 'data' member variable of the super
	/// class.
	///
