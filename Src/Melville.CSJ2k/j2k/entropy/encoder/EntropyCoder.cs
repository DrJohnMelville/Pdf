	/// <summary> This abstract class provides the general interface for block-based entropy
	/// encoders. The input to the entropy coder is the quantized wavelet
	/// coefficients, or codewords, represented in sign magnitude. The output is a
	/// compressed code-block with rate-distortion information.
	/// 
	/// The source of data for objects of this class are 'CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc'
	/// objects.
	/// 
	/// For more details on the sign magnitude representation used see the
	/// Quantizer class.
	/// 
	/// This class provides default implemenations for most of the methods
	/// (wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image and
	/// component dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the entropy
	/// coder. If that is not the case for a particular implementation then the
	/// methods should be overriden.
