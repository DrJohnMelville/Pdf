* Class:                   ByteOutputBuffer
*
* Description:             Provides buffering for byte based output, similar
*                          to the standard class ByteArrayOutputStream
*
*                          the old jj2000.j2k.io.ByteArrayOutput class by
*                          Diego SANTA CRUZ, Apr-26-1999
