	/// bytes, located at <see cref="MemoryBase"/>. The data are are not copied, and the client is responsible for
	/// releasing and destroying them after the corresponding call to <see cref="Face.Dispose()"/>.
	/// </description></item>
	/// <item><description>
	/// Otherwise, if the <see cref="OpenFlags.Stream"/> bit is set, assume that a custom input stream
	/// <see cref="Stream"/> is used.
	/// </description></item>
	/// <item><description>
	/// Otherwise, if the <see cref="OpenFlags.PathName"/> bit is set, assume that this is a normal file and use
	/// <see cref="PathName"/> to open it.
	/// </description></item>
	/// <item><description>
	/// If the <see cref="OpenFlags.Driver"/> bit is set, <see cref="Library.OpenFace"/> only tries to open the file
	/// with the driver whose handler is in <see cref="Driver"/>.

	/// If the <see cref="OpenFlags.Params"/> bit is set, the parameters given by <see cref="ParamsCount"/> and
	/// <see cref="Params"/> is used. They are ignored otherwise.
	/// </description></item>

	/// Ideally, both the <see cref="PathName"/> and <see cref="Params"/> fields should be tagged as ‘const’; this is
	/// missing for API backwards compatibility. In other words, applications should treat them as read-only.
